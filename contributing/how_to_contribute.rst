How to contribute
=================

The Redot Engine is free (free as in "beer" and free as in "speech") and open-source. Like any 
community-driven project, we rely on volunteer contributions of various types. On this page we want 
to showcase the ways you as users can participate - to help you find the right starting place with the 
skillset you have. Because contrary to popular opinion, we need more than just programmers on the project!


Fundraising
-----------

Since the Redot Engine is forked from the `Godot Engine <https://godotengine.org>`_, contributions 
to the `Godot Development Fund <https://fund.godotengine.org>`_ will cause any updates of the Godot 
Documentation to head downstream to us. The Redot Communuity currently does not have any way to 
accept monetary donations of any sort, so if you do want to contribute in that way and don't want to 
donate to the Godot Development Fund, here are some ways you can put your money to use:

- **Donation Drives**
  
  Think about your followers on social media, or other communities you are active in.
  Use that reach to remind your social environment that even small contributions can make a difference, 
  especially when done by a great number of people at the same time.

- **Publish Games and Tools with Redot**
  
  You heard right, simply publishing a game with the hashtag ``#MadeWithRedot`` can positively impact 
  the well-being of this project. Your personal success elevates the engine to a viable alternative 
  for other developers, growing the community further.
  
  Additionally, it opens the doors for us to approach industry contacts about possible cooperations.


Technical contributions
-----------------------

- **Report bugs & other issues**
  
  As active users of the engine, you are better equipped to identify bugs and other issues than anyone else.
  To let us know about your findings, fill out this `bug report form <https://github.com/Redot-Engine/redot-engine/issues/new/choose>`_ on our GitHub.
  Make sure to include as much information as possible to ensure these issues can easily be reproduced by others.

- **Test Development Versions**
  
  While it is recommended to use the stable releases for your projects, you can help us test dev releases, betas, and release candidates
  by opening a copy of your project in them and checking what problems this introduces or maybe even solves.
  Make sure to have a backup ready, since this can produce irreversible changes.

- **Contribute Engine Code (mainly C++)**
  
  The engine development is mainly coordinated on our `Discord <https://discord.gg/redot/>`_,
  so if you are serious about making PRs you should join us there!

  Read more about the **technical submission process**: :ref:`doc_first_steps`

- **Review Code Contributions**
  
  All pull requests need to be thoroughly reviewed before they can be merged into the master branch.
  Help us get a head start by participating in the code review process.

  To get started, chose any `open pull request <https://github.com/Redot-Engine/redot-engine/pulls>`_ 
  and reference our **style guide**: :ref:`doc_pr_review_guidelines`

- **Write Plugins (GDScript, C#, & more)**
  
  Community addons are not directly included in the core engine download or repository, yet they 
  provide essential quality of life upgrades for your fellow game developers.

  Upload your plugins to the `Godot Asset Library <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset>`_ to 
  make them available to others. It is planned to also have a Redot Asset Library as well, so stay tuned for that!

  ..
    update to talk about Asset Store later
- **Demo projects (GDScript, C#, and making Assets)**

  We don't currently have what Godot has with it's `demo projects <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/>`_ 
  repository, but it is a planned feature to have once more and more Redot specific features are added 
  to the engine. For now, we recommend that new users use those demo projects with the Redot Engine 
  to test new features and get familiar with the engine, and expand from there.

- **Documentation**
  
  The documentation is one of the most essential parts of any tech project, yet the need to 
  document new features and substantial changes often gets overlooked. Because of that, these pages 
  tend to not be the most user friendly. If you want to help contribute to making the documentation 
  of the Redot Engine the best it can be, join the `Discord <https://discord.gg/redot>`_ and start
  submitting pull requests to the `Github <https://github.com/Redot-Engine/redot-docs>`_

- **Translations (spoken languages other than English)**
  
  Are you interested in making the Redot Engine more accessible to non-English speakers?
  Contribute to Godot's `community-translations <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/godot-engine/godot/>`_. 
  All of those translations not only help Godot, but all of the forks of Godot, including us!

Community support
-----------------

- **Call for Moderators**
  With a community of our size, we need people to step up as volunteer moderators in all kinds of places.
  These teams are organized by the Godot Foundation, but would not function without the dedication of active community members like you.

  Have a look around your favorite community platform and you might come across open application calls.

- **Answer tech-support questions**
  With many new people discovering the Godot Engine recently, the need for peer-to-peer tech-support has never been greater.
  See the `Godot website <https://godotengine.org/community>`_ for a list of official and user-supported Godot communities.

- **Create tutorials & more**
  How did you get started with the Godot Engine?
  Chances are you looked for learning materials outside of what the documentation provides.
  Without content creators covering the game development process, there would not be this big of a community today.
  Therefore it seemed only right to mention them in a page about important contributions to the project.
