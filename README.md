# Redot Engine documentation

This repository contains the source files of [Redot Engine](https://redotengine.org)'s documentation, in the reStructuredText markup language (reST).

They are meant to be parsed with the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) documentation builder to build the HTML documentation on [Redot's website](https://docs.redotengine.org).

## Theming

This documentation uses the default `sphinx_rtd_theme` with many
[customizations](_static/) applied on top. It will automatically switch between
the light and dark theme depending on your browser/OS' theming preference.

If you use Firefox and wish to use the dark theme regardless of your OS
configuration, you can install the
[Dark Website Forcer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dark-mode-website-switcher/)
add-on.
