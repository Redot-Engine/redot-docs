Redot Engine Documentation
==========================

.. only:: not i18n

  .. note:: 
      Redot's documentation is available in various languages,
      thanks to all of the dedicated people in the Godot and Redot Communities.

      Expand the "Read the Docs" panel at the bottom of the sidebar to see
      the list.

.. only:: i18n

  .. note:: This documentation is translated from the `original English one
            <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable>`_ by community members
            on `Weblate <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/godot-engine/godot-docs>`_.

            Depending on the translation effort's completion level, you may
            find paragraphs or whole pages which are still in English. You can
            help the community by providing new translations or reviewing existing
            ones on Weblate.

            For the time being, localized translations are only available for
            the "stable" branch. You can still view the English documentation for
            other engine versions using the "Read the Docs" panel at the bottom
            of the sidebar.

Welcome to the official documentation of the `Redot Engine <https://redotengine.org>`__,
the free and open source community-driven 2D and 3D game engine, forked from the equally amazing
`Godot Engine <https://godotengine.org>`__ in August of 2024! If you are new to this documentation, 
we recommend that you read the :ref:`introduction page <doc_about_intro>` to get an overview of 
what this documentation has to offer.

The table of contents in the sidebar should let you easily access the documentation
for your topic of interest. You can also use the search function in the top-left corner.

The Redot Engine is an open source project developed by a community of volunteers.
The documentation team can always use your feedback to help and improve the tutorials, 
examples, and class references. If you don't understand something, or cannot find
what you are looking for, help us make the documentation better!

Submit an issue or pull request on the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/redot-engine/redot-docs/issues>`_.
This can include expanding the documentation, making sections easier to read, fixing grammatical mistakes,
translate these docs into another language, or style changes.
